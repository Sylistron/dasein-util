		The Dasein Attributes Library contains an API that enables you to associate arbitrary
		attributes with an object managed by a complex type manager. Valtira originally
		developed this API to manage attributes for elements in the
		<a href="http://simplicis.valtira.com" title="Simplicis web page">Simplicis Content
	    Management System</a>. In that system, a page may have an arbitrary set
		of attributes established by the developed. For example, a press release might have
		a dateline that includes a location and a date. The person creating the page type
		for press releases needs to tell the CMS to prompt content owners for that data and
		have it validated. So, the page type has two data types set up:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>a date of type &quot;date&quot;</li>
		<li>a location of type &quot;string&quot;</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		These generic attributes, or data types, are associated with the page type.
		When a content owner creates a press release, the UI prompts the content owner for
		values for date and location. The attributes library will then validate that entry
		and provide programmatic access to those values as instances of the correct Java
		data type (i.e. <code>java.util.Date</code> and <code>java.lang.String</code>).
	</p>
	<p>
		This library includes the following built-in data types:
    </p>
	<ul>
		<li>boolean</li>
		<li>currency</li>
		<li>date</li>
		<li>decimal</li>
		<li>number</li>
		<li>string</li>
    </ul>
	<p>
		You can implement your own custom data types by subclasses the <code>DataTypeFactory</code>
		and <code>DataType</code> classes and then creating a configuration file
		<i>/dasein/types.cfg</i> that simply contains the names of your factory implementation
		classes, one per line.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Dasein Persistence libraries additionally include utilities for persisting data
		types and stored attributes (both built-in and custom) to a database.
